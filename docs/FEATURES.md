## 🤖 Coding Assistant Setup

Your coding assistant (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Kilocode CLI) is:
- **Automatically launched** after project setup with initial prompt
- Pre-configured with framework-specific knowledge (via MCP or docs)
- Loaded with best practices
- Equipped with prompt management expertise
- Set up with testing methodologies
- Auto-detected - the CLI shows which assistants are installed on your system

## 📊 Agent Testing Pyramid

Better Agents enforces a comprehensive testing methodology:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test deterministic components
2. **Evaluations** - Measure and optimize probabilistic components using Jupyter notebooks
3. **Scenario Tests** - End-to-end validation with the Scenario framework

This ensures your agent is thoroughly tested and production-ready from day one.
