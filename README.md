# Superagents

Superagents is a CLI tool and a set of standards for agent building.

It supercharges your coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc), making it an expert in any agent framework you choose (Agno, Mastra, etc) and all their best practices, being able to autodiscover MCP tools to augment your agent.

The Superagent Structure and AGENTS.md ensures industry best practices, making your agent ready for production:
- [Scenario](https://github.com/langwatch/scenario) agent tests written for every feature to ensure agent behaviour
- Versioning of the prompts for collaboration
- Evaluation notebooks for measuring specific prompts performance
- Already instrumented for full observability
- Standardization of structure for better project maintainability


### The Superagent Structure

```
my-agent-project/
├── app/ (or src/)           # The actual agent code, structured according to the chosen framework
├── tests/
│   ├── evaluations/         # Jupyter notebooks for evaluations
│   │   └── example_eval.ipynb
│   └── scenarios/           # End-to-end scenario tests
│       └── example_scenario.test.{py,ts}
├── prompts/                 # Versioned prompt files for team collaboration
│   └── sample_prompt.yaml
├── prompts.json             # Prompt registry
├── .mcp.json                # MCP server configuration
├── AGENTS.md                # Development guidelines
├── .env                     # Environment variables
└── .gitignore
```

The structure and guidelines on `AGENTS.md` ensure every new feature required for the coding assistant is properly tested, evaluated, and that the prompts are versioned.

The `.mcp.json` comes with all the right MCPs set up so you coding assistant becomes an expert in your framework of choice and know where to find new tools.

[`scenarios/`](https://github.com/langwatch/scenario) tests guarantee the agent behaves as expected, which simulates a conversation with the agent making sure it does what expected.

`evaluations/` notebooks holds dataset and notebooks for evaluating pieces of your agent pipeline such as a RAG or classification tasks it must do

Finally, `prompts/` hold all your versioned prompts in yaml format, synced and controlled by `prompts.json`, to allow for playground and team collaboration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @langwatch/superagents
```

Or use with npx:

```bash
npx @langwatch/superagents init my-agent-project
```

- **[Walkthrough](examples/WALKTHROUGH.md)** - Detailed step-by-step guide
- **[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - How to contribute to Superagents
- **[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** - Version history

## Usage

### Initialize a new project

```bash
# In current directory
superagents init .

# In a new directory
superagents init my-awesome-agent
```

The CLI will guide you through:

1. **Programming Language**: Python or TypeScript
2. **Agent Framework**: Agno (Python) or Mastra (TypeScript)
3. **Coding Assistant**: Claude Code, Cursor, Kilocode CLI, or None (manual prompt)
4. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, OpenRouter, or Grok
5. **API Keys**: LLM Provider and LangWatch (required), Smithery (optional)
6. **Project Goal**: What you want to build

## Philosophy

Superagents promotes the **Agent Testing Pyramid** approach:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test deterministic components
2. **Evals & Optimization** - Measure and optimize probabilistic components
3. **Simulations** - End-to-end validation with Scenario

## Key Features

### 🎯 Framework Integration

- **Agno**: Automatically downloads `.cursorrules` and `llms.txt`
- **Mastra**: Configures Mastra MCP for real-time documentation

### 🧪 LangWatch Integration

- **Prompt CLI**: Manage versioned prompts
- **Scenario Testing**: End-to-end agent testing
- **Evaluations**: Measure component performance
- **MCP Server**: Expert guidance built into your coding assistant

### 🔧 MCP Tool Integration

- **Smithery Toolbox** (optional): When you provide a Smithery API key during setup, your coding agent gets automatic access to MCP tools for enhanced capabilities
- Auto-configured in `.mcp.json` for seamless integration
- Your coding assistant can discover and use tools to help build your agent

### 🤖 Coding Assistant Setup

Your coding assistant (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Kilocode CLI) is:
- **Automatically launched** after project setup with initial prompt
- Pre-configured with framework-specific knowledge (via MCP or docs)
- Loaded with LangWatch best practices
- Equipped with prompt management expertise
- Set up with testing methodologies
- Auto-detected - the CLI shows which assistants are installed on your system

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- A coding assistant (one of the following):
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code-agent) (`claude` CLI)
  - [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
  - [Kilocode CLI](https://www.kilocode.ai/) (`kilocode`)
- API Keys:
  - Your chosen LLM Provider API key
  - LangWatch API key (get one at https://app.langwatch.ai/authorize)
  - Smithery API key (optional - for MCP tool auto-discovery, get one at https://smithery.ai/account/api-keys)

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/langwatch/superagents
cd superagents

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development
pnpm dev init test-project

# Build
pnpm build
```

## Examples

### Python + Agno

```bash
superagents init trading-agent
# Select: Python, Agno, your preferred coding assistant, OpenAI
# Goal: "Build an agent that can analyze stock prices and provide trading recommendations"
```

### TypeScript + Mastra

```bash
superagents init customer-support
# Select: TypeScript, Mastra, your preferred coding assistant, OpenAI
# Goal: "Build a customer support agent that can handle common queries and escalate complex issues"
```

### Coding Assistant Auto-Launch

After project setup completes, Superagents **automatically launches** your chosen coding assistant with a customized initial prompt that includes:
- Your project goal
- Framework-specific context
- Best practices guidance
- Next steps to get started

The CLI detects which coding assistants are installed on your system and shows installed options first in the selection menu. Not installed assistants appear in gray with "(not installed)" but can still be selected.

You can also select **"None - I will prompt it myself"** if you prefer to manually launch your coding assistant later with the provided initial prompt.
